# ðŸ’« About Me:
Specializing in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js, I am a Full-Stack Developer with many years of experience. The main issue of front-end development is transforming into user-friendly web solutions. I guarantee that after using front-end frameworks such as Angular.js React, and j and following the best optimization practices for asset loading and the initial setup, this site is guaranteed to be fast.
My current learning journey includes mastering Generative AI and blockchain technologies.

The developer who writes clean, maintainable code is a developer that is me. I am not only dedicated to the project but also would like to find colleagues with whom I could do the same. We have not had this kind of end that we have tried with this project, and this was very interesting. And currently, I am very committed to it. Along with my technical skills, collaboratively I can be as convinced about my statements as a fact that it is the text typed out in front of you. The outcome was we collected a list of items that we wanted to be drawn with buyers instead of guests, which resulted in making decisions much faster.
